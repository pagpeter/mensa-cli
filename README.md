# CLIs in multiple languages for the Uni-Potsdam/HPI mensa menu

These CLIs are just for me for learning the languages / concepts and are probably not the best examples.

The API being used is https://mensa.aaronschlitt.de/docs/#/default/GetMeals.

I try to use as little external libraries as possible. The only thing required is curl for the C version.
